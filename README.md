A vending machine made in command line with Java. An assignment through Tech Elevator worked on with a partner.

##Usage

When the application starts, it looks for a vendingmachine.csv file, a sample of which is supplied in this code. 
This loads items into the machine. Once you have this, all other functions can be performed by putting money into the machine
and making purchases.

This machine keeps a log of purchases made. A sales report can be printed by inputting 0 in the main menu.
This will print the report as a CSV which includes the number of each item sold and a grand total of revenue.
