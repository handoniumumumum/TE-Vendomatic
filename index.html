<p>This Java application was made with a partner as a capstone for the Java module of my classes at Tech Elevator, a coding bootcamp.</p>

<p>This is far from the first application I made in Java, but it was the largest one I'd made in a while. While its functionality is mostly theoretical, it was meant to reflect what a vending machine coded in Java and running with a JVM would look like.</p>

<h2>
<a id="instructions" class="anchor" href="#instructions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

<p>When the application starts, it looks for a vendingmachine.csv file, a sample of which is supplied in this code. This loads items into the machine. Once you have this, all other functions can be performed by putting money into the machine and making purchases.</p>

<p>This machine keeps a log of purchases made. A sales report can be printed by inputting 0 in the main menu. This will print the report as a CSV which includes the number of each item sold and a grand total of revenue.</p>
